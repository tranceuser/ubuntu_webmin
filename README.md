## Prerequisites
Before proceeding with the installation process, you should ensure that your system meets the following requirements:
- Ubuntu Server 22.04 is installed and up-to-date
- A user account with sudo privileges
- A working internet connection
## Step 1: Adding Webmin Repository
The first step is to add the Webmin repository to your Ubuntu system. You can do this by running the following commands:
```
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://download.webmin.com/download/repository sarge contrib" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/webmin.list'
wget -q -O- http://www.webmin.com/jcameron-key.asc | sudo apt-key add -
```
These commands add the Webmin repository to your system's sources list and import the GPG key for the repository.
## Step 2: Installing Webmin
Next, update your system's package index and install Webmin by running the following commands:
```
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install webmin -y
```
The installation process may take a few minutes to complete.
## Step 3: Accessing Webmin
After installation, Webmin will be available on your system's default HTTP port (80). To access Webmin, open a web browser and navigate to http://<your-server-ip>:10000.
You may encounter a security warning about an untrusted certificate when accessing Webmin for the first time. This is normal and can be safely ignored. Click the "Advanced" button and proceed to access the Webmin login page.
## Step 4: Logging in to Webmin
Log in to Webmin using your system's root or sudo user credentials. Once logged in, you can use the Webmin interface to manage your system's resources and services.
